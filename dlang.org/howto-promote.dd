$(D_S Promoting D Projects (or Internet Marketing 101),

	$(P So you've written a cool project in D, and it's ready for others
	to use or to get involved with helping develop it further.
	Just posting a zip file isn't going to work. All your blood, sweat
	and effort will just go to waste.
	You'll need to provide a way for people who want to know about
	your project to be able to find it.
	)

	$(P The steps are:
	)

	$(OL
	$(LI Create a web page for the project)
	$(LI Let people know about it)
	)

$(H3 Creating a Web Page)

	$(P A good web page should include the following:
	)

	$(UL
	$(LI The keywords and phrases that someone who would be interested
	in your project might type into Google to find it.)

	$(LI The phrase $(B D programming language) somewhere on the page.
	This helps build the brand on the internet.
	If you just use $(B D), nobody will find it via search.)

	$(LI Screen shots of the program. Even better, for graphics
	and game demos, make a short video of it with
	$(LINK2 http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/windows-xp?tab=xpmm, Windows Movie Maker),
	which can capture movies directly from the screen.)

	$(LI List the capabilities of the package and what it's good for.)

	$(LI Identify who this package is intended for and why they'd
	want to use it.)

	$(LI Copyright and license information for any source code.
	If you intend for it to be
	$(LINK2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain, public domain),
	make sure to
	explicitly mark it so.)

	)

	)

	$(P Send me a cut-and-paste html snippet to place on
	$(LINK2 http://www.digitalmars.com/d/dlinks.html, dlinks).
	)

	$(P If your project is a conversion of an existing project to D,
	email the project leader of that existing project and suggest
	that he incorporate a link to your project on his page.
	)
