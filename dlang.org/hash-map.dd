$(SPEC_S Associative Arrays,

        $(P Associative arrays have an index that is not necessarily an integer,
        and can be sparsely populated. The index for an associative array
        is called the $(I key), and its type is called the $(I KeyType).)

        $(P Associative arrays are declared by placing the $(I KeyType)
        within the $(D [ ]) of an array declaration:
        )

        ---------
        int[string] aa;   // Associative array of ints that are
                          // indexed by string keys.
                          // The KeyType is string.
        aa["hello"] = 3;  // set value associated with key "hello" to 3
        int value = aa["hello"];  // lookup value from a key
        assert(value == 3);
        ---------

        $(P $(BLUE $(B Note:)) The built-in associative arrays do not preserve the order
        of the keys inserted into the array. In particular, in a $(D foreach) loop the
        order in which the elements are iterated is unspecified.)
        
$(H3 Removing Keys)

        $(P Particular keys in an associative array can be removed with the
        $(D remove) function:
        )

        ---------
        aa.$(CODE_HIGHLIGHT remove)("hello");
        ---------

        $(P $(D remove(key)) does nothing if the given $(I key) does not exist and
        returns $(D false).  If the given $(I key) does exist, it removes it
        from the AA and returns $(D true).
        )

$(H3 Testing Membership)

        $(P The $(GLINK2 expression, InExpression) yields a pointer to the value
        if the key is in the associative array, or $(D null) if not:
        )

        ---------
        int* p;
        
        p = ("hello" $(CODE_HIGHLIGHT in) aa);
        if (p !is null)
        {
            *p = 4;  // update value associated with key
            assert(aa["hello"] == 4);
        }
        ---------

        $(P Neither the $(I KeyType)s nor the element types of an associative
        array can be function types or $(D void).
        )

$(H3 Using Classes as the KeyType)

        $(P Classes can be used as the $(I KeyType). For this to work,
        the class definition must override the following member functions
        of class $(D Object):)

        $(UL
        $(LI $(D size_t toHash() @trusted nothrow))
        $(LI $(D bool opEquals(Object)))
        )

        $(P Note that the parameter to $(D opEquals) is of type
        $(D Object), not the type of the class in which it is defined.)

        $(P For example:)

        ---
        class Foo
        {
            int a, b;

            size_t $(CODE_HIGHLIGHT toHash)() { return a + b; }

            bool $(CODE_HIGHLIGHT opEquals)(Object o)
            {
                Foo foo = cast(Foo) o;
                return foo && a == foo.a && b == foo.b;
            }
        }
        ---

        $(P Care should be taken that $(D toHash) should consistently be the
        same value when $(D opEquals) returns true. In other words, two objects
        that are considered equal should always have the same hash value. If
        this is not the case, the associative array will not function properly.
        Also note that $(D opCmp) is not used to check for equality by the
        associative array. However, since the actual $(D opEquals) or $(D
        opCmp) called is not decided until runtime, the compiler cannot always
        detect mismatched functions. Because of legacy issues, the compiler may
        reject an associative array key type that overrides $(D opCmp) but not
        $(D opEquals). This restriction may be removed in future versions of
        D.)

$(H3 Using Structs or Unions as the KeyType)

        $(P If the $(I KeyType) is a struct or union type,
        a default mechanism is used
        to compute the hash and comparisons of it based on the binary
        data within the struct value. A custom mechanism can be used
        by providing the following functions as struct members:
        )

        ---------
        size_t $(CODE_HIGHLIGHT toHash)() const @safe pure nothrow;
        bool $(CODE_HIGHLIGHT opEquals)(ref const typeof(this) s) @safe pure nothrow;
        ---------

        $(P For example:)

        ---------
        import std.string;

        struct MyString
        {
            string str;

            size_t $(CODE_HIGHLIGHT toHash)() const @safe pure nothrow
            {
                size_t hash;
                foreach (char c; str)
                    hash = (hash * 9) + c;
                return hash;
            }

            bool $(CODE_HIGHLIGHT opEquals)(ref const MyString s) const @safe pure nothrow
            {
                return std.string.cmp(this.str, s.str) == 0;
            }
        }
        ---------

        $(P Care should be taken that $(D toHash) should consistently be the
        same value when $(D opEquals) returns true. In other words, two structs
        that are considered equal should always have the same hash value. If
        this is not the case, the associative array will not function properly.)
        $(P If necessary the functions can use $(D @trusted) instead of $(D @safe).)
        $(P Also note that $(D opCmp) is not used to check for equality by the
        associative array.  For this reason, and for legacy reasons, an
        associative array key is not allowed to define a specialized $(D
        opCmp), but omit a specialized $(D opEquals). This restriction may be
        removed in future versions of D.)

$(H3 Construction or Assignment on Setting AA Entries)

    $(P When an AA indexing access appears on the left side of an assignment operator,
        it is specially handled for setting an AA entry associated with the key.

        ---------
        string[int] aa;
        string s;
        s = aa[1];          // throws RangeError in runtime
        aa[1] = "hello";    // handled for setting AA entry
        s = aa[1];          // succeeds to lookup
        assert(s == "hello");
        ---------
    )

    $(P If the assigned value type is equivalent with the AA element type:

      $(OL
        $(LI If the indexing key does not yet exist in AA, a new AA entry will be
        allocated, and it will be initialized with the assigned value.)
        $(LI If the indexing key already exists in the AA, the setting runs normal
        assignment.)
      )

        ---------
        struct S
        {
            int val;
            void opAssign(S rhs) { this.val = rhs.val * 2; }
        }
        S[int] aa;
        aa[1] = S(10);  // first setting initializes the entry aa[1]
        assert(aa[1].val == 10);
        aa[1] = S(10);  // second setting invokes normal assignment, and
                        // operator-overloading rewrites it to member opAssign function.
        assert(aa[1].val == 20);
        ---------
    )

    $(P If the assigned value type is $(B not) equivalent with the AA element type,
        the expression could invoke operator overloading with normal indexing access:

        ---------
        struct S
        {
            int val;
            void opAssign(int v) { this.val = v * 2; }
        }
        S[int] aa;
        aa[1] = 10;     // is rewritten to: aa[1].opAssign(10), and
                        // throws RangeError before opAssign is called
        ---------

        However, if the AA element type is a struct which supports an implicit constructor
        call from the assigned value, implicit construction is used for setting the
        AA entry:

        ---------
        struct S
        {
            int val;
            this(int v) { this.val = v; }
            void opAssign(int v) { this.val = v * 2; }
        }
        S s = 1;    // OK, rewritten to: S s = S(1);
          s = 1;    // OK, rewritten to: s.opAssign(1);

        S[int] aa;
        aa[1] = 10; // first setting is rewritten to: aa[1] = S(10);
        assert(aa[1].val == 10);
        aa[1] = 10; // second setting is rewritten to: aa[1].opAssign(10);
        assert(aa[1].val == 20);
        ---------

        This is designed for efficient memory reuse with some value-semantics
        structs, eg. $(FULL_XREF bigint,BigInt).

        ---------
        import std.bigint;
        BigInt[string] aa;
        aa["a"] = 10;   // construct BigInt(10) and move it in AA
        aa["a"] = 20;   // call aa["a"].opAssign(20)
        ---------
    )

$(H3 Runtime Initialization of Immutable AAs)

    $(P Immutable associative arrays are often desirable, but sometimes
        initialization must be done at runtime. This can be achieved with
        a constructor (static constructor depending on scope),
        a buffer associative array and $(D assumeUnique):)

        ---------
        immutable long[string] aa;

        static this()
        {
            import std.exception : assumeUnique;
            import std.conv : to;

            long[string] temp; // mutable buffer
            foreach(i; 0 .. 10)
            {
                temp[to!string(i)] = i;
            }
            temp.rehash; // for faster lookups

            aa = assumeUnique(temp);
        }

        unittest
        {
            assert(aa["1"] == 1);
            assert(aa["5"] == 5);
            assert(aa["9"] == 9);
        }
        ---------
